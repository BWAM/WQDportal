# WQDportal
Water Quality Data Portal

This project will develop and maintain the central repository for water quality data for the NYSDEC's Water Quality Monitoring and Assessment Sections. The goal of the project is to develop a portal for internal, and eventually external, access to water quality monitoring data owned by the NYSDEC.

The following link is an example of the type of portal (function and layout) we hope to achieve https://zsmith.shinyapps.io/WQT_Shiny/
